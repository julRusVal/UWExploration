# Documentation for testing
Scripts and command for testing the merging of the multi-agent material with the main branch.

## pf_testing_tmux.sh
These commands were sent to me by Ginnie and should be up to date.

### STATUS
Not working but can serve as a template for how to use tmux

## ma_testing_pattern.sh
Basic script to launch a multi agent scenario.

## ma_tmux_path.sh
This script launches all of the required nodes for a multi agent scenario. Most things are broken out into their on tmux window, which might be causing issues with the timing of things.
